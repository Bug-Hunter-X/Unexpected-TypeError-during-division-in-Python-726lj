# Unexpected TypeError during Division in Python

This repository demonstrates a scenario where an unexpected `TypeError` can occur during division in Python, even with seemingly correct input types. The root cause often involves subtle type coercion issues or other hidden type conflicts.

The `bug.py` file contains code exhibiting this issue, while `bugSolution.py` offers potential solutions and workarounds.

## Problem Description

The Python code in `bug.py` defines a function to perform division.  Despite explicit type checking, a `TypeError` is raised under specific, perhaps uncommon circumstances. This demonstrates a situation where standard type checking may not be sufficient to prevent all type-related errors.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.py` file provides solutions to handle this uncommon `TypeError`.  These solutions focus on more robust type validation and handling to prevent the unexpected error.
